                <p>Mentors love GRT's emphasis on learning as they have the opportunity to bring industry practices and techniques to an impressionable group eager to learn effective methods and designs. They are engaged by the process of watching a group of high school students grow to become an integrated team of engineers who work together as professionals. The mentors themselves are motivated by the enthusiasm and eagerness that GRT members have for the design process and love to come into the shop and partake in the positive energy.</p>

            <p>&emsp;At the end of our 2020-2021 GRT school season, we say goodbye to our wonderful seniors as well as continue to work on current projects and goals for the next school year.  This year we participated in the virtual FRC 2021 season with submissions for the Animation Award, the Chairman's Award, the Game Design Challenge, and the Innovation Challenge.  We earned an engineering design award for Game Design, where we created our own game including rules, a CAD model of the playing field, and a game animation.</p>

            <p>&emsp;Since the re-opening of the Gunn HS campus in March, the majority of our rookies came on campus to participate in hands-on shop training including lathe, mill, and hand tools training.  Our 2021-22 shop trainers are working in the shop over the summer to build a teaching curriculum for the fall and continue to practice machining.  This summer we are also participating in the KLA RoboGames (an event for FRC teams sponsored by Awards by KLA) and we have sent submissions for the innovations award, leadership award, community award, and mentor award.</p>

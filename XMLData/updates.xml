            <p>&emsp;At the end of our 2020-2021 GRT school season, we say goodbye to our wonderful seniors as well as continue to work on current projects and goals for the next school year.  This year we participated in the virtual FRC 2021 season with submissions for the Animation Award, the Chairman's Award, the Game Design Challenge, and the Innovation Challenge.  We earned an engineering design award for Game Design, where we created our own game including rules, a CAD model of the playing field, and a game animation.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Q&A</b><br><br>
            - When is the camp? How long are camp sessions?<br>
            <ul>We're running two sessions of the camp, one during the week of June 13th and the second during the week of June 20th. Each session consists of 5 days (Monday through Friday), and each day runs from 9am to 3pm. On the registration form, students can select which session they'd prefer -- both sessions cover the same content.</ul>

            <span class= 'title bold'> Come join one week intensive online summer camp in which students get an introduction into the basics of engineering and computer science. Taught by members of the Gunn Robotics Team. </span><br>
            <p class='bold'>We are a student-led robotics team, experienced in peer-mentoring and teaching through a learn-by-doing mentality. We offer lessons and activities pertaining to the basics of engineering and robotics, as well as more specific skills that we have worked on extensively as a team.</p>
            <h3> Tinkercad </h4>
            <p> Give students an introduction to computer-aided design. Provide a basic understanding of CAD tools and allow them to creatively apply their skills in the form of a final project. </p>

            <h3> VEXcodeVR </h3>
            <p>Learn block-coding through engaging activities and lessons throughout the week, complete with a final project that allows students to use what they have learned as creatively as they would like. Provide a virtual introduction to robotics via event-based coding (block coding) and usage of various sensors. </p>            
            <span class='bold'>Both classes will also participate in a blue box challenge that gives students an introduction to the design process. Students apply critical thinking skills to build an efficient model to face a certain challenge. They will get to design creatively and develop basic engineering skills using simple at home materials. </span>

                  <span class='title bold'>Thank you for your interest in the Gunn Robotics Team's summer camp! Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, we will have to reassess the situation for summer camp and will update this page once we have finalized our plans. The text below is last year's information.</span><br>
                  <p class='bold'>Come enjoy a thrilling and valuable robotics experience with GRT! Campers will collaborate to build and code a fully-functioning VEX IQ robot to complete robotic challenges while learning the fundamental skills for being an engineer.</p>
